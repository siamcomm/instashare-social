This plugin adds Social Sharing buttons to the bottom of content in pages and posts, so your visitors can share your website's content.

== Description ==

This plugin adds Social Sharing buttons to the bottom of content in pages and posts.

We have purposely excluded the Home page for inclusion of the buttons. The script should work for custom post types as well.

Please keep in mind this is a very simple implementation. There are no Admin settings or configuration pages.
If you wish to have any social networks added that are not shown, please send me a message and I will add these.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `instashare` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Congratulations! Visit a post or p[age to see your new buttons at the bottom.]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add a social network sharing link for me? =

Absolutely. You can make the request at the WordPress repository, the GitHub repository or by using the Contact Us form on the website at [Siam Communications](https//siamcomm.com).

= Can I change the code myself? =

You can if you would like. The code can be downloaded or cloned from the [InstaShare Social](https://github.com/siamcomm/instashare-social) Git Hub repository.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
