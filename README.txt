This plugin adds Social Sharing buttons to the bottom of content in pages and posts, so your visitors can share your website's content.

== Description ==

This plugin adds Social Sharing buttons to the bottom of content in pages and posts.

We have purposely excluded the Home page for inclusion of the buttons. The script should work for custom post types as well.

Please keep in mind this is a very simple implementation. There are no Admin settings or configuration pages.
If you wish to have any social networks added that are not shown, please send me a message and I will add these.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `instashare` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Congratulations! Visit a post or p[age to see your new buttons at the bottom.]
